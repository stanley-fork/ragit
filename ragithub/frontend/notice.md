Find your knowledge-bases here!

Ragit is a rag tool that helps you create knowledge-bases in a git-like manner. Ragit's goal is to make knowledge-bases easy-to-create and easy-to-share. This is the place where you can easily share your knowledge-bases. Well, it's supposed to be where you can share yours, but only I can upload knowledge-bases here. I hope you can find ones that you need. If you want a knowledge-base of something, please open an [issue](https://github.com/baehyunsol/ragit/issues).

- [Ragit repository](https://github.com/baehyunsol/ragit)

## Contribute

If you want to share your knowledge-base,

1. Please add metadata to your knowledge-base using `rag meta` command.
  - I need `description` and `readme`. More metadata is welcome!
2. Run `rag archive -o your_knowledge_base.ar` to create an archive file.
3. Please send your archive file to `baehyunsol@naver.com`.
