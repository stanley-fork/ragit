NAME
----
rag-summary - Get the summary of the knowledge-base

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag summary' [--force | -f | --cached]
'rag summary' --remove
'rag summary' --set <summary>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
It shows you the summary of the knowledge-base. The summary is created by a
summary agent, and is cached and reused unless you edit the knowledge-base.

Historically, `rag build` command calls the summary agent after the build is
complete. This behavior was disabled because it takes too long to create a
summary. You can enable it with `rag config --set summary_after_build true`.

If the summary is outdated or you haven't created one, this command will call
the summary agent. It takes time and money to create a summary. If you don't
want this behavior, use `--cached` option. It will show you the summary if it's
cached, otherwise die.

If you want to remove the cached summary and create a new one, you can either
use `rag summary --remove; rag summary` or more simply `rag summary --force`.

If you're still not satisfied with the AI-generated summary, you can write one
on your own! Use `rag summary --set` command to set the summary of the
knowledge-base manually.

For now, the summary is used in 2 places.

1. When the user wants to know about the knowledge-base, they can run
   `rag summary` to get one.
2. `rag query --agent` may read the summary to understand the knowledge-base.
