NAME
----
rag-clone - Clone a knowledge-base into a new directory

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag clone' <remote url> [<directory>] [--quiet | -q]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Like `git clone`, it clones a knowledge-base and copies it to a newly created directory.

You can think of 2 use cases of `rag clone`

1. Clone a complete knowledge-base and query it.
2. Clone a half-built knowledge-base and continue building it. Or, you can clone multiple half-built ones and merge them.

Ragit will support both use cases, but the second one is not stable yet. Cloning a half-built base is not tested yet, and
`rag merge` is still heavily under construction.
