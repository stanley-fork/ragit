NAME
----
rag-ls-terms - Show information about search terms

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag ls-terms' [--term-only | --stat-only] [--json] [<uid>..]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Run `rag help uid-query` to read how uid-query works. If the uid is of an image, it dies. Later
versions will allow `rag ls-terms` on images.

Ragit uses tfidf algorithm to retrieve texts, and tfidf uses a tokenizer. This command shows
how your documents are tokenized. It shows how many times each term in a chunk appears. It's
also know as TF (term-frequency). If you provide a uid of a file, it merges TFs of chunks in the
file. It's NOT a TF of merged chunks, but a merged TF of chunks. It's different because chunks have
sliding windows. If a term appears once in a file, but is included in a sliding window. `rag ls-terms`
will tell you that the term appears twice.

If no uid is given, it shows a merged TF of all the chunks.

If `--json` is set, it dumps a valid json to stdout. Its schema is,

- no flags: `{ term: term_count }`
- `--term-only`: `[term: string]`
- `--stat-only`: `{ "terms": integer, "unique terms": integer }`
